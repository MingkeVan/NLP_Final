<h1>Amplifying a Sense of Emotion toward Drama-
Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network for dynamic emotion
recognition <br>

</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We want to use the NNIME database to study the emotion behavior (such as arousal and valence state) in small duration (like in
real time), and to augment a sense of emotional feeling with visual demonstration. After all of this, we just wonder how the emotion application can be. Therefore, we think of the amplification of the emotion in video. There are a lot of video that you would feel awkward watching it because of its boring and no effect. So we want to amplify the context in the video to make the video better.
